# Example of minimal OpenCL program in Rust

This small program is based on sample code from "Heterogeneous Computing with OpenCL".
I have rewritten it using Rust language.
The opencl.rs was generated with rust-bindgen and then manually updated.

Developed and tested on Windows 7 64-bit with 64-bit Rust compiler.
Build scrit expects AMDAPPSDKROOT environment variable to be set to location where AMD APP SDK is installed.
